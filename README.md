# TypicalProgramming
This is the source code for the Typical programming language. Guess what it does...it creates a Typical programming language. 
HAHAHA SEE WHAT I DID THERE!!!

Anyway, I was bored one day so I decided to test out my Python skills and give this a go. It's still a work in progress but WOOOOO I am having fun.

Couple of things with this code:
  Please do not distribute it please. I put this code up for people interested in seeing what it's like to go through the logic of a programming language.
  If you do try showing it off, please link the github and my username in whatever platform you are using. Make sure that somehow, people know who made it.
  
 Thank you so much for checking it out. I'll add more to this as it goes on but for now, let's see where this goes.
